### To-Do
- [x] Add hashtag from the caption, remove stopwords and add them

- Make the script more memory friendly
   - Use native `csv` then `pandas` for look up
   - Or use sql database

- More instagram terms and conditions friendly
   - Get the text from the image, and check for cursed words, if found use another image
   - [x] profanity chacked and removed from caption

-  [x] Create script which support both vidoes and images

- Current code is not business oriented, providing no value at all. Change the theme of the Instagram account
